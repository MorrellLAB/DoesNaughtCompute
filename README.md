## Introduction\_to\_Python
### 2/12/2016

The Introduction to Python session covered chapters 1 and 2 of *Bioinformatics Programming Using Python*. We talked about how Python works as a programming languge, then looked at types in Python, focusing on primitive types, as well as explored the difference between functions and methods. In addition, we looked at if/else statements, while loops, and for loops.

The `IntroToPython.py` script is a coding challenge looking at some light sequence analysis and translating DNA into protein.
