### Exercise 1:
Adapter trimming:

The file `seq.txt` contains a number of DNA sequences, one per line. Each sequence starts with the same 14 base pair fragment – a sequencing adapter that should have been removed. Write a program that will (1) trim this adapter and write the cleaned sequences to a new file and (2) print the length of each sequence to the screen. 

### Exercise 2:
Dict of list creation

Let’s reuse the `TAIR10_Chr4.gff` file from last session
For this exercise, find the start positions of all exons for each gene ID (i.e. `AT4G00570.1`) and store them as a dictionary of lists. Next, find all exon start positions for the gene id: `AT4G00570.1`

One possible solution is given in the `complex_data_structures_demo.py` script in this directory.
