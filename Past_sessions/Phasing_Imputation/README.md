# Phasing, Imputation, and Error Detection

The process of phasing variants so that the parental stand of each variant can be identified can be accomplished both experimentally and computationally. Imputation of genetic data is computational, and typically involves inference of variant state based on a smaller number of variants. Error detection can be applied to genotyping or resequencing data and has applications for computationally and experimental phasing and in imputation.
