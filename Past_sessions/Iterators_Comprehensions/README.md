## Chapter 6: Iterators, Comprehensions and Generators
### 4/22/2016

This chapter introduces the reader to the concept of iterators, and two convenient constructs that generate them called comprehensions and generators.  While comprehensions and generators are most commonly performed on lists, they can also operate on sets and dictionaries.

The `enum_edit_tedious.py` script is an example script that enumerates all possible terms with a single change around a word or DNA sequence.  It has numerous for loops that could much more succinctly be expressed as list comprhensions.  The reader is encouraged to re-write the script so that every generated list is created by a list comprehension.
