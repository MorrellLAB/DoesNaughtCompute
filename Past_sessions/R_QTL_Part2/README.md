This session will focus on using R/QTL for quality control and have some info
about using R/QTL in non-F2 populations. Data for this session were generated
with [simcross](https://github.com/kbroman/simcross), and the accompanying
scripts.

There is also a brief list of other R packages that exist for other population
designs.
