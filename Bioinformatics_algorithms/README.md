# Bioinformatic Algorithms

We will be working through selected chapters from [Bioinformatics Algorithms by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/index.htm).

Datasets used during our discussions are from [Rosalind Problems Bioinformatics Textbook Track](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track). These correspond with the exercises from the book.
